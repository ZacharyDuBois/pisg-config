# PISG Config

This repository houses the configuration for [PISG](http://pisg.sourceforge.net) on my ZNC server. It creates all my [IRC stat pages](https://ircstats.zacharydubois.moe/).

# Notes

- If you have aliases or a link, open an issue and I will add them.
- If you do not want to be displayed on the stats page, please create an issue and I will add you to the blocks list.
- I will not remove any blocks in the bans section.
- If spam shows up on a stat page, please open an issue so I can ban the nickname.
- If you don't want stats generated for your channel and you are the channel owner, open an issue and I will remove it.
